# Portfolio Project

This repository is a showcase of my work and is intended for portfolio purposes. It demonstrates various skills and technologies I have worked with in my development journey.

## Important Notice: Missing Files

Some files, configurations, and environment-specific settings might be missing from the repository intentionally. This is because:

- **Sensitive Information:** Certain files (like `.env` files) containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) have been excluded from the repository for security reasons.
  
- **File Exclusions:** Some files or configurations may have been intentionally excluded to keep the repository clean and focused on the most relevant code and functionality for this portfolio showcase.

- **Development Environment:** Some configurations or dependencies may vary based on the environment where the code is being run (e.g., production, development, etc.). Please refer to the documentation below for environment setup details.
